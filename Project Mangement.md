Project Title

AI Trading Strategy Agent with Prompt Optimization using ScaleDown API

1. Project Overview

1.1 Project Description

The AI Trading Strategy Agent is an intelligent system designed to analyze financial market data and generate automated trading strategies using Artificial Intelligence. The system integrates the ScaleDown API to optimize AI prompts, reduce token usage, and improve response speed. The system helps users make data-driven trading decisions using technical indicators and machine learning models.

1.2 Project Goals

Develop an AI-based trading strategy system

Reduce AI operational cost using prompt optimization

Provide trading signal generation and performance analysis

Create an interactive visualization dashboard

2. Problem Statement

Modern trading systems rely on artificial intelligence to generate trading strategies. However, AI systems require large prompts that increase processing cost, token consumption, and response time. Traders require fast and cost-efficient strategy generation.

This project aims to develop an intelligent trading agent that generates trading strategies while reducing computational cost using ScaleDown API.

3. Project Objectives

The primary objectives of the project are:

To collect and analyze financial market data

To implement technical indicators such as RSI, MACD, and Moving Average

To generate AI-based trading strategies

To optimize AI prompts using ScaleDown API

To develop a backtesting module

To provide performance visualization through dashboards
